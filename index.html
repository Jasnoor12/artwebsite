        <p>Hi I am Jasnoor Saini and you might have already guessed I love art, I strated getting into art when I was young, when I was around 6 I had this fun art competition at school so that's whe I discovered how much I loved art now being older I have strated sharing my art. I really enjoy it because it allows my imagination to go away and it lets me be creative.<br><br>Here are some facts about art:

        In 2003 street artist Banksy stuck his own work to the wall in the Tate Modern Museum
        Learning art correlates strongly with your achievements in math and reading
        Creating a website or designing a home requires mastering skills which are developed through arts education
        Roman statues were made with detachable heads so that one head could be removed and replaced by another
        Picasso could draw before he could walk, and his first word was the Spanish word for pencil
